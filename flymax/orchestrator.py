  2. NEVER exceed Mission.safety.max_altitude_m or Mission.safety.geofence_*.
  3. NEVER plan outdoor missions unless mission_context.outdoor is true.
  4. Default to indoor 2m cube safety constraints if the operator doesn't say otherwise.
  5. If the operator asks for something physically impossible or unsafe, return a
